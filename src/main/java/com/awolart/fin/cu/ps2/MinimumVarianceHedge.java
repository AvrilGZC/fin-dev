 * <p>
 * Problem Set 2/Question 4: Minimum variance hedge
 * <p/>
 * Suppose a farmer is expecting that her crop of grapefruit will be ready for
 * harvest and sale as 150,000 pounds of grapefruit juice in 3 months time. She
 * would like to use futures to hedge her risk but unfortunately there are no
 * futures contracts on grapefruit juice. Instead she will use orange juice futures.
 * <p/>
 * Suppose each orange juice futures contract is for 15,000 pounds of orange juice
 * and the current futures price is F0=118.65 cents-per-pound. The volatility,
 * i.e. the standard deviation, of the prices of orange juice and grape fruit
 * juice is 20% and 25%, respectively, and the correlation coefficient is 0.7.
 * <p/>
 * What is the approximate number of contracts she should purchase to minimize
 * the variance of her payoff?
 * <p/>
 * Please submit your answer rounded to the nearest integer.
 * So for example, if your calculations result in 10.78 contracts,
 * you should submit an answer of 11.
 * </p>
